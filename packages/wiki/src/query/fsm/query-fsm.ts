/**
 * The query pipeline as a flat Finite State Machine.
 *
 * `IntentDetection → Retrieve → SelectSections → Summarize → Respond → Verify →
 * Response`, with `NegativeResponse` reachable from `IntentDetection` (off-corpus),
 * `Retrieve` (no candidates), and `SelectSections` (filter kept nothing).
 *
 * Retrieval runs two front-ends in parallel inside the `Retrieve` handler — the
 * mechanical hybrid (FTS + vector) search and the LLM topic/doc-topic class
 * ladder — merged into one evidence pool; the per-subject fan-out is
 * handler-internal so the topology is fixed regardless of subject count. There
 * is a single pipeline, so no pluggable `Route`/`Pipelines` composite.
 *
 * A wildcard `["*", "error", ""]` transition terminates from ANY state: when a
 * stage throws, `guarded` (in `load.ts`) records the failure on `QueryProgress`
 * and yields `error`, exiting all sub-states and ending the process declaratively
 * (no imperative engine `terminate` call).
 *
 * Validated by `@statewalker/fsm-validator` (0 errors / 0 warnings) — see
 * `tests/fsm/query-fsm.validate.test.ts`.
