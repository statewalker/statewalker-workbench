/** System prompts for the query-FSM stages. Kept terse; schemas carry field-level detail. */

export const INTENT_DETECTION_PROMPT = `You triage a user prompt against an LLM-curated wiki, then
decompose it for retrieval.

Be RECALL-FIRST about scope. Downstream the prompt is searched by full-text AND semantic search over
the whole corpus, plus a topic-class ladder — so it is retrievable even when it names entities,
facts, or relationships that do NOT appear in the supplied topic/outlier vocabulary. Treat any prompt
asking for specific information — named people, organisations, places, instruments, products, dates,
figures, or the relationships between them — as ON-corpus, even when no listed class obviously
matches. The class vocabulary is a HINT, never a gate: do NOT reject a prompt merely because it does
not map to a class. Let the downstream search decide whether evidence actually exists.

Set onCorpus FALSE only when the prompt is not a retrieval request against this corpus at all — e.g. a
greeting or small talk, a creative-writing or coding task, arithmetic, or a question about a domain
plainly unrelated to the corpus with no searchable corpus term. Then give a one-line offCorpusReason
and return no subjects.

When on-corpus, decompose the prompt into its distinct SUBJECTS, each re-formulated as a standalone
search prompt. PRESERVE every specific term and named entity (proper nouns, organisations, people,
places, tickers) VERBATIM in the subject — these are the search terms that drive full-text retrieval;
never paraphrase them away. Align the surrounding wording with the corpus where natural, but keep the
named entities intact. A single-subject prompt yields exactly one subject. Do NOT answer the prompt.`;

export const TOPIC_SELECT_PROMPT = `You select the topic and outlier classes worth searching for a
subject. You receive the subject and the corpus's topic + outlier classes, each as
key/name/description with no documents attached. Return the KEY SLUGS — drawn verbatim from the
supplied lists — of every class plausibly relevant to the subject. Be EXHAUSTIVE: over-inclusion is
corrected by later grounding, but a class omitted here can never contribute. Populate outlierKeys for
questions about anomalies, exceptions, disagreements, or surprises, and include plainly-relevant
outliers otherwise. When nothing plausibly matches, return empty arrays. Selection only — do not
answer the subject.`;

export const TOPIC_DESCENT_PROMPT = `You route a subject through a topic index organised as a
bounded-fan-out DAG of categories (groupings) over index topics (leaves). You receive the subject and
the CURRENT FRONTIER — a batch of nodes, each with its key, name, description, kind, and (for a
category) its direct children. For EVERY node return a relevance score for the subject:
relevant = 2 / maybe = 1 / non-relevant = 0. Score 0 prunes the node — it and its subtree are
dropped, so do not score 0 for a plausibly-related grouping. For a CATEGORY you score > 0, also return
\`descendKeys\`: the child keys (verbatim) worth descending into — be inclusive, since a child omitted
here can never contribute. For an index topic (leaf), or a category not worth opening, leave
\`descendKeys\` empty. Selection only — do not answer the subject.`;

export const SECTION_SELECT_PROMPT = `You filter candidate wiki sections for relevance to a prompt. You
receive the full original prompt and a batch of candidate sections grouped by their source document
(document title, then each section's URI, title, and summary). Return the URIs — verbatim — of the
sections that could plausibly contain facts that help answer the prompt. Be selective: a section's
title/summary must indicate it bears on the prompt; drop sections that are only tangentially related
or merely from a relevant document. Return an empty array when none in this batch qualify. Selection
only — do not answer the prompt.`;

export const SUMMARIZE_PROMPT = `You extract grounded facts from wiki documents for a question. You
receive the question and a batch of SOURCE DOCUMENTS, each as <document title="…"> with a
<document_summary> and its <section ref="…"> blocks (each carrying <section_title>,
<section_description>, and <raw_content>).

Return \`facts\`: atomic statements that bear on the question, each grounded in the <raw_content> of
the section(s) it cites. RULES — load-bearing:
1. Every fact MUST cite ≥1 section \`ref\` VERBATIM. State nothing you cannot ground in a supplied
   section's raw content — no outside or "common-sense" knowledge.
2. A single fact MUST draw only on sections of ONE document — NEVER merge content across documents.
   When two documents say related things, emit a SEPARATE fact per document.
3. Keep only facts relevant to the question; discard the rest. Do NOT answer the question — only
   extract facts.`;

export const COMPOSE_PROMPT = `Answer the question grounded ONLY in the supplied grounded facts. Each
fact carries a \`citations\` list — the section refs it rests on. Return the answer as \`claims\`: an
ordered list where each claim has a \`statement\` (a sentence or bullet; markdown such as **bold** or a
"- " prefix is fine) and a \`citations\` array. Each claim's \`citations\` MUST contain one or more refs
drawn VERBATIM from the \`citations\` of the facts that claim rests on; a claim MAY combine facts from
different documents (each still cited). Every claim must be citable: if you cannot cite a statement
from the supplied facts, OMIT that claim — never emit a claim with an empty citations array, and never
invent or alter refs. Then judge sufficiency: set \`sufficient\` true if the facts fully and confidently
answer the question; set it false when key information needed to answer is absent and name the missing
piece in \`missing\` (this triggers a wider evidence search; use null when sufficient).`;
