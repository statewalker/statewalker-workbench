 * Typed per-query state for the query FSM.

 * this single context instance. `project` / `request` / `progress` are injected at
 * launch; per-query data is held in private, default-initialized fields that stages
 * read via getters and produce via the semantic methods below. Project-global
 * capabilities (LLM, wiki config) are NOT carried here — handlers reach them via
 * `llmOf(ctx.project)` / `wikiConfigOf(ctx.project)`.
