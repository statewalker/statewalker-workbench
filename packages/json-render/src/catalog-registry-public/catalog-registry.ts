 * value is typed as `unknown` because the registry is held opaquely
 * (json-render's types stay at the rendering boundary, not in this
 * adapter's surface).
 *
 * Same id-keyed semantics as `ViewRegistry` and
 * `InlineContentRegistry`, inherited from the shared
 * `IdentifiableRegistry` primitive.
