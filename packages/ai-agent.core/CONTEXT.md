# @statewalker/ai-agent

Domain language for the agent runtime: agent loop, conversation state, context shaping for model calls, tool/skill registries, model providers, and session persistence. The package is framework-free — UI and commands live in `@statewalker/ai-provider-core` and the consuming apps.

## Language

### Three-tier API

**AgentRuntime**:
Project-level entry point. Owns providers, tools, skills, the FilesApi split (system vs tools view), MCP clients, and session storage. Built once and stays alive for the host process.

**Agent**:
A *definition* — name, tools whitelist, skills whitelist, system prompt, default model. Loaded from `<systemPath>/agents/*.md` or created programmatically.
_Avoid_: agent instance, agent worker

**Session**:
A *runtime instance* bound to one Agent. Owns the conversation tree, inbox, per-session tool/skill views, and the agent loop. Persisted by id under `<systemPath>/sessions/`.

### Conversation state

**SessionState**:
The persisted state of one Session — the tree of Turns, Messages, ToolCalls, and TurnGroups. Pure data; a typed view over `TreeNode`. Lives at `state/session-state.ts`. The runtime Session holds it as `.state`.
_Avoid_: ConversationTree, SessionNode.

**Turn**:
One inbox-message exchange — opens with a user message, accumulates agent messages, tool calls, and tool results, closes when streaming finishes. Exactly one Turn per inbox message (invariant of the agent loop).

**TurnGroup**:
A summarised run of Turns produced by compaction. Wraps adopted children; carries `depth`, `stamp`, and a `summaryText`. Never drops data — original Turns remain reachable as descendants.

**Inbox**:
Async queue of pending user messages. The agent loop drains it; one `take()` per Turn.

**TreeNode**:
The underlying typed node primitive. Implementation detail of the state tree — callers work through `Session`/`Turn`/`Message`/etc. accessors.

### Agent loop

**TurnDriver**:
Advances a `SessionState` by one **Turn** given one inbox message. Owns the per-turn lifecycle: open Turn, optional first-turn skill selection, ContextWindow build, `streamText` invocation, stream-part routing, finish classification, error recording. Stateless across calls — `state` is passed per invocation. One instance per `Session`; constructed by `runtime/Session` ctor.
_Avoid_: agent controller, turn runner

**Session.run** is the session-scope orchestrator. It drains the **Inbox**, delegates each message to `TurnDriver.drive()`, and buffers `turn-finish` events on the first turn so the title generated via `generateText` is already set when consumers persist on `turn-finish`.

### Context shaping

**ContextWindow**:
The module that, given the current `SessionState` and the active `SkillsModel`, produces `{ system, messages, events, stats }` for one model call. Internally orchestrates compaction, selection, elision, pin policy, summarisation, and system-prompt assembly. Mutates the tree (compaction artifacts persist); returns a projected snapshot. One instance per Session — `Agent.createSession()` constructs it with package defaults (`selectAll`, no budget compaction). Consumers needing compaction construct a `ContextWindow` directly and pass it to a `Session` — the runtime no longer carries selection/compaction tunability.
_Avoid_: context builder, context manager, prompt builder

**compaction**:
Tree-shaping that adopts older Turns under `TurnGroup` wrappers when token budget is exceeded. Hierarchical — depth-1 groups can be promoted to depth-2 and beyond. Always summarises before adopting; never drops data.

**elision**:
Projection-only shortening of tool-call results when forming `ModelMessage[]`. Never mutates the tree. Driven by `ToolElisionPolicy`.

**pin policy**:
Decides which nodes are protected from compaction (e.g., recent turns, user-flagged turns). Honoured by both compaction and selection.

**selection**:
Projection from the tree to `ModelMessage[]` for one model call. Honours pin policy and elision; collapses TurnGroups to their summaries unless a pinned descendant forces expansion.

**stamp**:
Identifier marking a set of TurnGroups produced in the same compaction pass. Lets observers attribute groups to a specific compaction event.

**context-thrash**:
The event emitted when compaction cannot get the session under budget within `maxPassesPerCompact`. The model call still proceeds; the consumer sees the event in the log stream.

### Tools and skills

**ToolRegistry**:
Per-session collection of named tools available to the agent. Built from runtime-wired tools plus MCP-bridged tools plus per-Agent whitelist.

**SkillsModel**:
Per-session collection of `available` and `selected` skills. Skills are markdown files loaded from `<systemPath>/skills/`. Selected skills inject their content into the system prompt.

**skill**:
A markdown file with a YAML frontmatter — declarative guidance the agent can activate via the `use_skills` tool.

### Models

**ModelManager**:
Manages local-engine model lifecycle: registration, download, verification, activation, weight storage. Distinct from cloud providers (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google), which are passed in directly as `ProviderV3`.

**ModelStateStore as ProviderV3**:
`ModelStateStore` implements `ProviderV3` directly (`specificationVersion = "v3"`, `languageModel(id)`, `embeddingModel`/`imageModel` throw `NoSuchModelError`). `AgentRuntime.addModelProvider()` accepts only `ProviderV3`. Callers holding a `ModelManager` pass `modelManager.provider` (a getter that returns the underlying store typed as `ProviderV3`).

### Files

**FilesApi split**:
The `AgentRuntime` builds two views over the root `FilesApi`: a **system view** (full visibility — config, secrets, agents, skills, sessions) and a **tools view** (system path-tree hidden via `FilteredFilesApi`). Tools and skills receive the tools view through `AgentContext.files`.

**FilesSplit**:
Free function `buildFilesSplit(rootFiles, opts)` returning `{ systemFiles, toolsFiles, paths }`. Owns the geometry validation and the path-normalisation helpers (`normalizeFolderPath`, `isUnderSystem`, `toSystemRelative`). Tested in isolation; `AgentRuntime` calls it once during `build()`.

**Agent disk loading**:
`AgentRuntime.build()` walks `<systemPath>/agents/*.md` via a private `_loadAgentsFromDisk` method and registers each file as an `Agent` definition (skipping names already present from `createAgent`). The previous `AgentCatalog` class was folded back into `AgentRuntime` after the boundary stopped earning its cost.

**Skill disk loading**:
`AgentRuntime.build()` walks `<systemPath>/skills/*.md` via a private `_loadSkillsFromDisk` method. Manually-registered skills (via `addSkills(...)`) come first; disk-loaded skills append. The previous `SkillsLoader` class was folded back for the same reason.

**Agent.createSession()** is the wiring site (relocated from `runtime/Session` ctor in opportunity #4): builds the per-session inbox / tools / skills, filters by Agent definition, registers built-in tools, bridges MCP, builds the `ContextWindow` + `TurnDriver`, and constructs the slim `Session`. `Session` itself is now a thin data class taking a pre-built bag of dependencies — no longer reaches into `AgentRuntime`.

## Relationships

- An **AgentRuntime** owns many **Agents** and creates many **Sessions**.
- A **Session** is bound to exactly one **Agent** and owns one **SessionState**, one **Inbox**, one **ToolRegistry**, and one **SkillsModel**.
- A **SessionState** contains many **Turns** and **TurnGroups** as direct children.
- A **TurnGroup** adopts a contiguous run of **Turns** or lower-depth **TurnGroups**.
- The **ContextWindow** reads a **SessionState** + **SkillsModel** and produces inputs for one model call; it may mutate the tree via compaction.
- The **TurnDriver** uses a **ContextWindow** to build the model-call inputs, then advances the **SessionState** by exactly one **Turn** per call.
- A **Session** owns one **TurnDriver** and one **ContextWindow**; `Session.run()` drains the **Inbox** and delegates each message to `TurnDriver.drive()`.
- **compaction** produces **TurnGroups**; **selection** projects the tree to `ModelMessage[]` honouring **pin policy** and **elision**.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When the model loop opens a new **Turn**, does **compaction** run before or after?"
> **Domain expert:** "Before. The **ContextWindow** is built per model call — compaction is its first step, then selection projects the tree. The fresh Turn the loop just opened is empty at that point, so it's always pinned by the recent-tail rule."

> **Dev:** "If **elision** never mutates the tree, where does the elided text live?"
> **Domain expert:** "Only in the **ModelMessage[]** that **selection** produces. The tool result on the **ToolCall** stays full-fidelity in the **SessionState** — reload the session and you see the original."

## Flagged ambiguities

- The state-side `Session` was renamed to **SessionState** in opportunity #3; a `@deprecated` `Session` alias remains for one cycle to keep external consumers compiling. Wiring relocation into `Agent.createSession()` is deferred to opportunity #4.
- "context" alone is ambiguous — could mean `AgentContext` (the DI bag passed to tool factories) or the **ContextWindow** (the model-call inputs). Prefer the full term.
